# ABSTRACT DOCS FOR IMPLEMENTATION CREATORS AND MAINTAINERS.
**Please keep in mind that the docs in this folder aren't for any one specific implementation of libalgebra. 
These are prototypes by developers for programmers. Pseudo-code is used, described below.**

## Overview
These docs are prototypes for a theoretical library, "libalgebra." These are functions that reverse-engineer the textbook problems for Algebra I students in the US before CommonCore was implemented, solve them, and possibly output an HTML page with MathML that shows how the problem was solved for students who are learning without the help of a teacher, e.g. for homework. Note that a true learner will not cheat with this tool. It all comes down to the motives behind the person using the tool, not the tool itself (but you'd still allow people to shoot each other anyway...oops, rhetoric).

The original implementation is intended to be in Rust for concurrency experimentation, but a C# implementation could be underway as well.

## Pseudo-Coded Dementia
The following format is how you can read functions:

```
function(variable0, variable1, etc);
```

While we are aware that most languages force you to implement a type, this is abstract for a reason. Python does not have both float and double types, whereas C# and Rust do. "Typeless" variables in the above example are:

`variable0`

`variable1`

`etc`

You can use variables like this whichever way the implementation language's type system will allow them to be written. Returned values may vary between implementations. If you don't like one, there can be others created.
